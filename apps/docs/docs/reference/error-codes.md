# Error code reference

Error notices in Volund follow a uniform **`code: English detail`** format (same on
the web console and mobile):

```text
tool_loop_exhausted: Reached the per-turn limit of 25 consecutive tool-call rounds; …
```

- The `code` is a cross-module contract: emitted by core → rendered by the UI →
  classified by telemetry → greppable by you. Every value lives in a single registry,
  [`packages/shared/src/error-codes.ts`](https://github.com/JS-mark/volund-code/blob/main/packages/shared/src/error-codes.ts).
  Codes must be registered before use; `pnpm verify:error-codes` enforces this
  bidirectionally in CI (an unregistered literal fails, and so does a registry entry
  nothing emits).
- Detail text is always English, so it stays grep- and log-friendly. This page is the
  human-readable catalog.
- This page is maintained in lockstep with the registry; if a code shows up in an
  error notice but is missing here, the registry wins — and please file an issue.

## Turn errors (`error.raised`)

These codes surface directly in web/mobile session notices and are the ones you will
meet most often:

| code                                    | meaning                                                                                                                     | trigger & what to do                                                                                                                                 |

| `tool_loop_exhausted`                   | The turn reached its tool-call loop cap (25 by default, configurable via `runner.maxToolLoopsPerTurn`)                      | Large tasks (e.g. scaffolding a whole project) can exhaust one turn; completed changes are kept — send a follow-up message to continue in a new turn |
| `subagent_budget_exhausted`             | A resource budget ran out (tokens / cost / time / tool calls — the detail names the dimension)                              | Raise the matching budget and continue                                                                                                               |
| `stream_interrupted`                    | The model stream dropped (network blip, server disconnect; the detail carries the cause, e.g. `read ECONNRESET`)            | Usually retryable; check network/proxy if it repeats                                                                                                 |
| `stream_resume_unsafe_partial_tool_use` | The stream broke mid tool-call, leaving a partial argument that cannot be resumed or replayed safely                        | The turn aborts; start a new request                                                                                                                 |

| `runner_error`                          | Catch-all for turn execution failures (the detail is the original error, e.g. a model that lacks vision receiving an image) | Fix the input or config per the detail                                                                                                               |

::: tip Approval and question cards
Permission approval cards that travel through the gateway are **auto-denied after
120 seconds** without a decision, and question (ask) cards are **auto-closed** on
the same clock (`GATEWAY_PERMISSION_TIMEOUT_MS`; set it to `0` to disable the
fallback). The model then sees `permission_timeout: <tool> approval timed out …`
or `ask_timeout: …` as the tool result — that means "nobody answered in time",
not "permissions are misconfigured". If remote tasks keep stalling, check whether
anyone answered the card.

## Native workers (reserved)

Registered for the native worker pools but not emitted yet — the pools currently
degrade via restart counters instead of surfacing these codes:

| `fs_worker_crashed`     | The fs worker pool lost a worker (B.2 §5.8)       |
